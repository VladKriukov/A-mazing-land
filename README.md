You're in a maze full of doors. Escape the almost endless maze by finding the keys to unlock the doors that match the colour of the key!  This is a re-make of my very old game I once made for a Ludum Dare game jam thich was very simple and 2D. This is also my first time ever using the Godot engine so it was quite a learning curve, but it's a great engine.
